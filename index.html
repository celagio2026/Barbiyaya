                    <h4>A Therapy Club</h4>
                    <p>As fellow scholars, we understand how difficult it may be to find a sympathetic ear whenever you need it. So, we made the decision to create a club that aims to address that certain issue. Our club, Barbiyaya, is a place where people can openly express their emotions without inhibition or fear. We aim to make our club a safe space for everybody, so we guarantee that everything we talk about in the club stays just between us. We also aim to aid those who are having trouble expressing themselves and their emotions. You can decide whether to participate in group therapy sessions through Barbiyaya with your closest friends, future friends, or even just by yourself.</p>
